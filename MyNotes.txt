#Mike Quinn Notes

Okay so I only evaluated the code, outside of Unity because they were moved outside the project so I didn't get to see it in action.
It does seem like you are learning, but you are using some cool methods like delegates and the singleton pattern. 

When you go through my comments, you are going to notice some themes,
1. You need to start using namespaces. They should be the first thing you do when making a new script.
2. You need to figure out a new system for grabbing references. You can't use Find statements for everything because that won't scale with your projects
	By that, I mean that as your projects get bigger, the resource hit will grow as well for every call and that isn't sustainable.
3. Although you aren't following the Microsoft naming conventions, you are consistent which is always great

There were some small nitpicking on the code, some lines could have been shortened and you 100% never need to do a GetComponenet call on Transform.
Other than that I'd say you are in a good spot to keep growing. From your code it looks to me like you have an understanding of programming beyond what a normal
beginner would have but you need more practice working with Unity.

Good luck on your future development.
